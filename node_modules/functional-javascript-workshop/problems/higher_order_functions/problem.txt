A higher-order function (also functional form, functional or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following:

* take one or more functions as an input
* output a function

All other functions are first order functions. [1]

Implement a higher-order function that takes a function and calls it 'n' times.

Hint: Recursion.

It's ok to use a loop in your implementation, bonus points
if you don't.

Arguments:

* operation: A Function, takes no arguments, returns no useful value.
* num: the number of times to call `operation`

```js

function repeat(operation, num) {
  // SOLUTION GOES HERE
}

module.exports = repeat
